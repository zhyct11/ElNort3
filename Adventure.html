                                    ITwo of the most enchanted waterfalls in the nation, Kabigan Falls and Anuplig Falls, are located deep within the pristine jungles of Ilocos Norte. The 80-foot-tall Kabigan Falls, a favorite among tourists, makes a grand impact. Anyone who dares to swim in its popular natural pool in the concave catch basin will feel revitalized.
                                    Anuplig Falls, a two-layered cascade in the small Adams village, is not to be outdone. The Patapat Viaduct is just 200 meters away on a lovely side trip that takes 45 minutes to complete. Take a cool break in one of the two on-site swimming pools, or peep behind the waterfalls to discover a secret grotto.

                                    Pagudpud Beach is a must-see location when in Ilocos Norte, although the volume of visitors makes it difficult to relax there. Instead, focus on Kingfisher Beach, the ideal retreat for timid adventurers. It is quiet while while being crammed with must-do water sports like kite surfing. Kingfisher Beach is the location of the kite surfing championships in the north and is well renowned for its large wave break and strong winds. At this secluded resort, which also provides surfing, stand-up paddleboarding, and snorkeling trips, learn from the best. Even non-swimmers will enjoy splashing around in the shallow 200-meter beach. You can always remain at one of their air-conditioned lodgings by the beach if your journey home is too lengthy.

                                    Hannah's Beach Resort delivers a major adrenaline rush to those who dare, so thrill seekers need look no further. The famed Blue Lagoon is traversed by its 1.15km-long zipline, the longest over-water zipline in the entire globe.
                                    For a fantastic memento, ride the zipline face down and do the Superman stance! In addition to their well-known zipline, Hannah's Beach Resort also provides a wide range of water sports. Visitors can ride the waves on a jet ski, kayak, or surfing board, or they can splash around Blue Lagoon with the group on a fly fish and banana boat.

                                <p>
                                    The Kapurpurawan Rock Formation, a geological wonder you must see for yourself, is situated on Burgos' wild shore. Ilocos Norte has been proud of its unique formations made from the white limestone rocks that have been there for thousands of years. Although it is completely forbidden to climb the rock formations, you must cross off trekking through the shining white landscape from your list of Ilocos Norte adventurous activities. Make sure you go earlier because it might get quite hot and crowded. You can take a tricycle side trip to the Bangui Windmill, the Cape Bojeador Lighthouse, and other surrounding sights.

                                <p>
                                    Hiking in Ilocos Norte is a no-brainer for outdoor enthusiasts since its provinces are bordered by the northern half of the Cordillera range. Be clear that Mt. Sicapoo is not for the faint of heart, though. As its name implies, it's a difficult climb because it's the highest point in the north. Its name is a derivation of "suko na po," or "I give up," in Tagalog. The ascent of Mt. Sicapoo, however, makes the trek to the twin mountains of Mt. Timarid and Mt. Simigaysay more tolerable. The cold air and pine trees compensate for the steep ridges that block the view of the adjacent villages of Ilocos Norte.

                                <p>
                                    In Ilocos Norte, sand excursions are arguably the most well-liked outdoor pursuits, and with good reason. You'll be treated to a wild and bumpy trip across the undulating terrain of Paoay Sand Dunes once you're in your all-terrain vehicle of choice. Instead, get onto the back of a 4x4 jeep for a freewheeling and thrilling adventure. For a good 30 minutes, the wheels will be flying off, so hold on to your buddies as tightly as you can. Don't be hesitant to do this for yourself because a qualified driver will make sure that everyone is secure and having a good time.
